# EXPLORER
The same old EXPLORER Project now available in web version.

# History
EXPLORER Project had a long history of development. It was started as a typical Win32 program which was used as the collection of indexes, called formerly as encyclopedia branches. Since the version 4.0, those functions were lost due to its discontinuation in the end of 2019.
Now it's the fifth version which is fully online. It includes the same EXPLORER-style web apps like explorer, media, etc, with added beaufont and sysview apps to display font and text files. The EXPLORER Project has a simple, Metro UI-like design, with 12 color themes.
Since the version 5.0, EXPLORER implemented the sound themes associated with each color theme. Clicking on each color button reloads the page with a new sound theme will play as the page loads completely.
